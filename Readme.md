## 🚀 Introduction

AI agents are transforming how businesses connect people, automate decisions, and streamline operations. This project uses **Gemini Flash AI agents** to automate the end-to-end matching of professionals (like *fundis*) with clients by evaluating skills, experience, tools, and job descriptions in real time.

Our AI agents act as autonomous digital assistants that can:
- Understand and process natural language from job descriptions and CVs
- Learn from historical matching data to improve accuracy
- Make intelligent decisions based on multiple criteria
- Adapt to changing requirements and preferences
- Work 24/7 to ensure continuous matching operations

With AI-powered smart matching, our system improves **accuracy**, reduces **time-to-hire**, and provides a **seamless experience** for users.
